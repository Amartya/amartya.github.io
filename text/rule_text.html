It was a dark and stormy night. Our family was just sitting down for dinner when we started hearing strange noises coming from the attic. Suddenly a light turned on in the kitchen and the TV started blaring from the living room. Energy monsters were attacking our house, and they were hungry for power! <br>The monsters started out too weak to do much damage, but they quickly grew stronger as they feasted on wasted electricity. Help stop the monsters before it\'s too late...

<ul><li>15 room tiles</li><li>36 monster cards</li><li>36 human cards</li><li>3 human tokens </li><li>3 monster tokens (Wattwolf, Ampire, and Bonehead)</li><li>1 energy spinner</li><li>Hit point tokens (green marbles)</li></ul>


Build a house by arranging the 15 room tiles so that all rooms are connected by doorways. Place rooms with the dark side of the tile facing up. The layout of the rooms does not need to make sense--remember this is a haunted house!<br><br>There are three special rooms, the Attic, the Basement, and the Back Porch. Monsters start in these rooms, so it\'s a good idea to make sure they\'re not too close to the Dining Room. 

<ol><li>Players form two teams: humans versus monsters.</li><li>Shuffle the monster deck and deal 5 cards to the monster team.</li><li>Shuffle the human deck and deal 5 cards to the human team. </li><li>Place the 3 human tokens in the dining room for dinner.</li><li>Place 1 monster token in each of the three portal rooms: the Attic, the Basement, and the Back Porch. </li><li>Set the spinner to 100 watts. This is the minimum amount used by things that are always on in your house (like the water heater and refrigerator).</li><li>Give each team 6 hit points (green marbles).</li></ol>


Monsters go first and then the two teams alternate turns. On your turn, your team can do the following three actions in order:<br><ol><li>Draw new cards to bring your hand up to 5 cards.</li><li>Move one of your tokens at most 1 space through an open door to an adjacent room.</li><li>Play as many cards as you want from your hand, but with at most one attack card. You may also discard up to one card.</li></ol><br><h2>Objective</h2>Play ends when one of the teams loses all of their points.


The power spinner shows how much energy is being used and how strong the monsters are.<br><br>Use the spinner when playing an attack card.<br><br>Set the arrow to match the total power used by all rooms in the house. The maximum value is 1,400 watts, even if the total power of all rooms in the house is more than that.<br><br>The human team wants the spinner to land in the black area, and the monster team wants it to land in the color area. 

Monsters gain strength by wasting energy.<br>The monster team plays waste cards to turn on appliances and devices. Before playing a waste card, you must move the correct monster to the room shown on the card.<br>For example, to turn on the TV, you must first move the Ampire to the living room. After playing the card, flip the room tile over to the light side and add 200 watts to the power spinner.<br><h3>NOTE: </h3>If there is a human in the same room, then the room is guarded. You cannot play a waste card in a guarded room.<br>

Humans can turn things off by playing one of three switch cards (light switches, power buttons, and sockets). Room tiles show the type of switch that can be used in that room.<br>To turn something off, move a human to the room and play the matching switch card. Flip the room tile back over to the dark side and reduce the power spinner by the indicated amount.<br><h3>NOTE: <h3>If there is a monster in the room, then the room is guarded. You cannot play a switch card in a guarded room.


Attack cards are played against an opponent in the same room as one of your tokens.<br><br>Spin the spinner. If it lands in the colored area for monsters or in the black area for humans, your opponent loses one hit point.<br><br>If the spinner lands on the opposite color, nothing happens.<br><br>When you lose all 6 of your hit points, you lose the game.<br><br>Attack cards can also be used to break down locked doors in the same room. Spin the spinner. If you\'re successful, the lock is broken.  


Play a Skeleton Key card to lock doors. Place a marker on a doorway in a room occupied by one of your team\'s tokens.<br><br>After the door is locked, it can only be opened again by playing an Attack Card. Both the humans and the monsters can attack a door to break it down.


Bonehead is a mindless energy waster. He\'s always forgetting to turn things off when they\'re not being used. 

Ampires love doing things inefficiently. Watch out or they\'ll run the dishwasher when it\'s half empty.

Wattwolf wastes energy by using old, inefficient appliances.
